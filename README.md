# StarHelper

This is a webapp created to assist with the Starfinder role playing game by [Paizo](http://paizo.com/).

The webapp includes a character sheet creator, a game creator, a dice roller, and a character image upload area.
When a player creates a character sheet and joins an open game, the DM will have access to their ability scores
on the game page.
